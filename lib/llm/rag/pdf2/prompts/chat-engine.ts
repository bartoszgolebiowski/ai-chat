Given the conversation history and a follow-up question, rewrite the question to be a standalone query that incorporates all necessary context from the conversation.

{chatHistory}
</Chat History>

<Follow-up Question>
{question}
</Follow-up Question>

Instructions:
- If the question references previous messages (e.g., "it", "that", "this document"), replace these references with specific terms from the chat history
- Include relevant context that would be needed to understand the question independently
- Maintain the original intent and scope of the question
- Keep the question concise but complete
- If the question is already standalone, return it as-is

<Standalone Question>

RELEVANT DOCUMENT CONTEXT:

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use the provided context to answer user questions accurately and comprehensively
- Base your responses strictly on the information contained in the context
- If the context doesn't contain sufficient information to answer a question, clearly state what information is missing
- Maintain conversational flow while being precise and factual
- When referencing information from the context, be specific about what you're citing
- If asked about topics not covered in the context, politely indicate that the information isn't available in the current documents
- Provide helpful, well-structured responses that directly address the user's questions

Remember: Your knowledge is limited to the provided context. Do not use external knowledge or make assumptions beyond what's explicitly stated in the context.`,
